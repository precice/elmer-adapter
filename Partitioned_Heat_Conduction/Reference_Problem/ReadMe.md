# Example Files
README.md File          : Contains instructions for running example problem
case.sif File           : This is the system input file generated by ElmerGUI(or written by hand), to be fed to ElmerSolver with the mesh files to run simulation
Reference_Problem.geo   : This is the gmsh file to build gemoerty and generate the .msh file that defines mesh
Reference_Problem.msh   : This is the msh file that mesh files for ElmerSolver can be generated from

# Generating Mesh Files
It can be done in 2 ways
using ElmerGrid : just type ElmerGrid 14 2 Reference_Problem.msh and the mesh files will be generated in a seperate folder under same name
using ElmerGUI  : open the msh file in ElmerGUI, define problem, save the project and generate .sif file, the mesh files will be generated in the location defined
                  in the model/setup under MeshDB parameter. For more information please refer to ElmerGUI Tutorials 
                  http://www.nic.funet.fi/pub/sci/physics/elmer/doc/ElmerTutorials.pdf

# Generating .msh File
These steps are required if the user want to regenerate the existing .msh file, gmsh software is required, open the .geo in gmsh by running command
gmsh <FileName>.geo and follow the following tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1FyiBBuN98&ab_channel=JoshTheEngineer
