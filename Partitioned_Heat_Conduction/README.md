# Example Problem
This is an example problem to qualify Data communication of data communication
developped in the adapter, it is a simple 2D problem, a 2x2 square plate
where the boundaries temperature are set according to equation 1 + x^2 + 2 * y^2.

# Example Files
* README.md File          : Contains instructions for running example problem 
* case.sif File           : This is the system input file generated by ElmerGUI(or written by hand), to be fed to ElmerSolver with the mesh files to run simulation 
* Reference_Problem.geo   : This is the gmsh file to build gemoerty and generate the .msh file that defines mesh 
* Reference_Problem.msh   : This is the msh file that mesh files for ElmerSolver can be generated from 

# Generating Mesh Files
It can be done in 2 ways
* using ElmerGrid : just type ElmerGrid 14 2 Reference_Problem_grid.msh and the mesh files will be generated in a seperate folder under same name
* using ElmerGUI  : open the msh file in ElmerGUI, define problem, save the project and generate .sif file, the mesh files will be generated in the location defined
                  in the model/setup under MeshDB parameter. For more information please refer to ElmerGUI Tutorials 
                  http://www.nic.funet.fi/pub/sci/physics/elmer/doc/ElmerTutorials.pdf

# Generating .msh File
These steps are required if the user want to regenerate the existing .msh file, gmsh software is required, open the .geo in gmsh by running command
gmsh <FileName>.geo and follow the following tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1FyiBBuN98&ab_channel=JoshTheEngineer

# Running Reference Example
* Step 1    : Generate msh Files, type ElmerGrid 14 2 Reference_Problem.msh -out Reference_Problem_Mesh
* Step 2    : Run Simulation, type ElmerSolver Reference_Problem.sif and wait for simulation to finish
* Step 3    : visulaize results, results should exist in Results folder, run paraview and open .vtu files to se solution
* Hint      : Results in other examples not necessarily exist in Results folder, the location can be modified in .sif file

# Running Dirichlet Example
* Step 1    : Generate msh Files, type ElmerGrid 14 2 Dirichlet_Participant.msh -out Dirichlet_Participant_Mesh
* Step 2    : Run Simulation, type ElmerSolver Dirichlet_Participant.sif and wait for simulation to finish
* Step 3    : visulaize results, results should exist in Results folder, run paraview and open .vtu files to se solution
* Hint      : Results in other examples not necessarily exist in Results folder, the location can be modified in .sif file

# Running Neumann Example
* Step 1    : Generate msh Files, type ElmerGrid 14 2 Neumann_Participant.msh -out Neumann_Participant_Mesh
* Step 2    : Run Simulation, type ElmerSolver Dirichlet_Participant.sif and wait for simulation to finish
* Step 3    : visulaize results, results should exist in Results folder, run paraview and open .vtu files to se solution
* Hint      : Results in other examples not necessarily exist in Results folder, the location can be modified in .sif file
