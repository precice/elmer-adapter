# Example Problem
This is an example problem to qualify Data communication of data communication
developped in the adapter, it is a simple 2D problem, a 2x2 square plate
where the boundaries temperature are set according to equation 1 + x^2 + 2 * y^2.

# Example Files
* README.md File          : Contains instructions for running example problem 
* case.sif File           : This is the system input file generated by ElmerGUI(or written by hand), to be fed to ElmerSolver with the mesh files to run simulation 
* Reference_Problem.geo   : This is the gmsh file to build gemoerty and generate the .msh file that defines mesh 
* Reference_Problem.msh   : This is the msh file that mesh files for ElmerSolver can be generated from 

# Generating Mesh Files
It can be done in 2 ways
* using ElmerGrid : just type ElmerGrid 14 2 Reference_Problem_grid.msh and the mesh files will be generated in a seperate folder under same name
* using ElmerGUI  : open the msh file in ElmerGUI, define problem, save the project and generate .sif file, the mesh files will be generated in the location defined
                  in the model/setup under MeshDB parameter. For more information please refer to ElmerGUI Tutorials 
                  http://www.nic.funet.fi/pub/sci/physics/elmer/doc/ElmerTutorials.pdf

# Generating .msh File
These steps are required if the user want to regenerate the existing .msh file, gmsh software is required, open the .geo in gmsh by running command
gmsh <FileName>.geo and follow the following tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1FyiBBuN98&ab_channel=JoshTheEngineer

# Build the adapter
The adapter is called during runtime by Elmer, it is developed as user defined code provided by Elmer features, so it has to be built before running the simulation,in order to do so, Elmer provides a fortran wrapper to make sure that user defined code is compiled using the same settings used to comiple ElmerSolver. Also while building the adapter, preCICE library has to be linked while building the adapter, so the path of preCICE shared library mus be provided.
To compile the adapter, type `elmerf90 -o Coupler_Solver.so Coupler_Solver.F90 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libprecice.so.2`.

For locating the path of preCICE shared library, type `dpkg -L libprecice2`, this will list all the files related to prceCICE package, search for the path of the shared library, it should be located in `/usr/lib`

# Running Reference Example
* Step 1    : Go To Reference_Problem/
* Step 2    : Generate msh Files, type ElmerGrid 14 2 Reference_Problem.msh -out Reference_Problem_Mesh
* Step 3    : Run Simulation, type ElmerSolver Reference_Problem.sif and wait for simulation to finish
* Step 4    : visulaize results, results should exist in Results folder, run paraview and open .vtu files to se solution
* Hint      : Results in other examples not necessarily exist in Results folder, the location can be modified in .sif file

# Running Dirichlet Example
* Step 1    : Go To Dirichlet_Participant/
* Step 2    : Generate msh Files, type ElmerGrid 14 2 Dirichlet_Participant.msh -out Dirichlet_Participant_Mesh
* Step 3    : Run Simulation, type ElmerSolver Dirichlet_Participant.sif and wait for simulation to finish
* Step 4    : visulaize results, results should exist in Results folder, run paraview and open .vtu files to se solution
* Hint      : Results in other examples not necessarily exist in Results folder, the location can be modified in .sif file

# Running Neumann Example
* Step 1    : Go To Neumann_Participant/
* Step 2    : Generate msh Files, type ElmerGrid 14 2 Neumann_Participant.msh -out Neumann_Participant_Mesh
* Step 3    : Run Simulation, type ElmerSolver Dirichlet_Participant.sif and wait for simulation to finish
* Step 4    : visulaize results, results should exist in Results folder, run paraview and open .vtu files to se solution
* Hint      : Results in other examples not necessarily exist in Results folder, the location can be modified in .sif file
