# Example Problem
This is an example problem to implement the adapter based on it, it is a 2D Pipe with 3.5 meter long(x-direction) and 0.75 height(y-direction) where fluid enters the pipe with a speed 0.1 m/s and at temperature 300 K, below the piep exists a heated plate from the bottom at 310 k. The problem is divided into 2, the solid part and fluid part. The Solid part starts calculating the heat transfer and then calculate the flux at the coupling interface and sends it through preCICE to the fluid part, by its turn caclulates the flow and temperature and sends back the temperature values at the coupling interface.

# Example Files
* README.md File          : Contains instructions for running example problem 
* case.sif File           : This is the system input file generated by ElmerGUI(or written by hand), to be fed to ElmerSolver with the mesh files to run simulation 
* Solid_Particpiant.geo   : This is the gmsh file to build gemoerty and generate the .msh file that defines mesh 
* Solid_Particpiant.msh   : This is the msh file that mesh files for ElmerSolver can be generated from 

# Generating Mesh Files
It can be done in 2 ways
* using ElmerGrid : just type ElmerGrid 14 2 Reference_Problem.msh and the mesh files will be generated in a seperate folder under same name
* using ElmerGUI  : open the msh file in ElmerGUI, define problem, save the project and generate .sif file, the mesh files will be generated in the location defined
                  in the model/setup under MeshDB parameter. For more information please refer to ElmerGUI Tutorials 
                  http://www.nic.funet.fi/pub/sci/physics/elmer/doc/ElmerTutorials.pdf

# Generating .msh File
These steps are required if the user want to regenerate the existing .msh file, gmsh software is required, open the .geo in gmsh by running command
gmsh <FileName>.geo and follow the following tutorial https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1FyiBBuN98&ab_channel=JoshTheEngineer

# Running Example
* Step 1    : Generate msh Files, type ElmerGrid 14 2 Solid_Participant.msh -out Solid_Participant_Mesh
* Step 2    : Run Simulation, type ElmerSolver case.sif and wait for simulation to finish
* Step 3    : visulaize results, results should exist in Results folder, run paraview and open .vtu files to se solution
* Hint      : Results in other examples not necessarily exist in Results folder, the location can be modified in .sif file
* Hint      : The case.sif file calls an external solver which is the adapter make sure that the adapter location is correct as well as the function it is calling
* Hint      : Also within the adapter the .xml file is read so make sure the correct location is described in the case.sif file.
